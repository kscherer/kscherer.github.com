# {{ page.title }}

I am a Canadian Software Engineer living in Ottawa, Canada

I work on Embedded Linux at
[Wind River](http://windriver.com/products/linux.html) on the build
systems team. My latest project has been a build cluster using Xen to
help test the building of the distribtion on as many flavours of Linux
as possible. I relied heavily on the communities around Linux, Xen,
Cobbler, Puppet and more. I hope to share my experiences and further
contribute to these wonderful communities.

## Do Not Follow me

I do not have a Facebook, Twitter, Google+ account. I have never been
comfortable giving away that much personal information to any
company. I may set up a RSS feed for convenience as soon I get more
familiar with Jekyll

## No Tracking

I browse with NoScript and ScriptNo and Ghostery because I do not like
companies tracking my web surfing. So the only logical way to set up
my blog was to not add tracking by Google Analytics or GetClicky,
etc. If I were going to do this I would use something like
[Piwik](http://piwik.org/) so at least the tracking is not be
aggregated into some larger database.
