# {{ page.title }}

I am a Canadian Software Engineer living in Ottawa, Canada

I work on Embedded Linux at
[Wind River](http://windriver.com/products/linux.html) on the build
systems team. My latest project has been a build cluster using Xen to
help test the building of the distribtion on as many flavours of Linux
as possible. I relied heavily on the communities around Linux, Xen,
Cobbler, Puppet and more. I hope to share my experiences and further
contribute to these wonderful communities.
