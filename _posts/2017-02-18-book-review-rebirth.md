This book is a fictional/auto biographical account of one mans journey
on the Camino pilgrimage trail in Spain. I really enjoyed it. The
characters are quirky and very human with baggage and beautiful
experiences. The dialogue is a little too perfect, but it made me
consider doing a long walk like this.

Some of my Favorite quotes from the book:

    Questions that help guide the way, like the yellow arrows on the
    Camino

Too often I hear about guiding values and statements, but I really
like the idea of guiding questions. Tim Ferris and his podcast guests
often talk about questions that guided their decisions.

    "If I loved myself, what would I do?"

I find this a tough question because it feels selfish. Finding a
balance between selfishness and selflessness never ends. I wish there
was a single answer, but I know that isn't possible.

    "Don't ask why, ask 'Now what'? People have made it through horrific
    times not by focusing on why but moving on and asking 'Now What?'"

Trying to understand is important, but sometimes the energy is better
spent on getting ready for the future.

    "It is not the wound that makes you special, it is the light that
    shines through it"

A great reminder that the hardships of life define you as much as the
successes. I have always marvelled at artists that were able to
transform immense pain into incredible music and art.

    "Perfect is no unnecessary pain. I wish you a perfect Camino."

Unfortunately sometimes pain is necessary. Pain is such a multi
faceted concept and hard to talk about. Maybe I will find someone who
can do it more eloquently than I can.
