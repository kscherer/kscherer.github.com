I play violin with the
[Ottawa Chamber Orchestra](http://ottawachamberorchestra.com/) which
is an amateur orchestra. Our conductor is David Theis-Thompson who is
also a professional violinist/violist with the NAC orchestra. He is
one of the best conductors I have ever been lucky enough to play
with. I hope to share some of his wisdom here:

"Remember that in Edward Grieg's music, there are always trolls"

"You have to play it just like Brahms, even if it is Schumann"
