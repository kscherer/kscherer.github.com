I found the format strange for a book because it felt like a
collection of short blog posts. The writing was very repetitive and
with all the other books I have read by authors like Seth Godin, the
message didn't feel new or motivating. I kept reading hoping for some
insight or inspiring wording but I finished the book feeling
disappointed. Almost every day the daily blog post by Seth Godin
resonates with me and/or inspires me, but this book did not.

Rating: Not recommended
