Most of the bare metal hardware that I manage now supports or defaults
to UEFI. Many have the option to use "Legacy BIOS" mode, but the main
feature I find that I require from UEFI is support for the boot volume
to be 2TB+. I prefer one single RAID0 volume for all the builders for
operational simplicity.

### Foreman

My preferred solution for installing the base OS on the hardware
is [Foreman][1]. It makes automated installs very simple and
reproducible but has only recently supported UEFI and PXE. I will
describe my previous attempts to get this working and how I was able
to get it working with Foreman 1.14.2.

### Pxelinux and UEFI

Pxelinux is part of the [syslinux][2] project and provides many
different types of bootloaders. Pxelinux depends on a custom ROM
inside the network card to run DHCP and download kernel+initrd using
TFTP. It also has support for displaying interactive menus to the
user.

UEFI contains all this functionality but unfortunately did not think
to extend it or preserve backwards compatibility. All boot time
programs like grub2 and pxelinux required significant rework. I was
able to use the syslinux git tree and compile a working EFI version of
pxelinux that was able to boot the 14.04 Ubuntu installer. But there
were limitations:

* Foreman only supported non-efi Pxelinux and I had to manually swap
  the binaries on the TFTP server
* The menu system didn't work so I could not use the Foreman feature
  of leaving the system to boot PXE by default and booting the local
  hard drive if rebuild was not enabled for that host in Foreman.
* I could not get this pxelinux to work with 16.04 installer. The
  initrd would be downloaded and would hang and trigger a system reset.

### UEFI and GRUB2

Foreman 1.13 added support for GRUB2 and UEFI, but my initial attempts
failed. When I changed the boot template from PXELinux to PXEGRUB2 the
update of the DHCP server would fail. The DHCP entry was added
properly to the DHCP server using the Foreman Proxy, but it would
cause a traceback on the server and prevent the Host change from being
saved. This bug was fixed in 1.14 and I was finally able to get this
working. There was one more bug in the PXEGRUB2 boot template
involving an assumption about Profiles. I opened an issue and have
submitted a PR to the community templates for this.

### TFTP preparation

Foreman adds a DHCP record which contains the following:

    server.filename = "grub2/grubx64.efi";

First step was to find the proper grub2 binary. Fortunately the Ubuntu
wiki had a helpful post covering [UEFI PXE netboot][3]

I was able to find the xenial grubnetx64.efi [here][4].

    cd /var/lib/tftpboot/
    mkdir grub2
    ln -s grubnetx64.efi grubx64.efi

Foreman will also place the correct kernel and initrd into the boot
directory. It will not replace an older kernel, so sometimes a newer
kernel and initrd need to be download from [here][5] and manually
added to the boot directory.

### How does it work?

Here is how this works:

1. Start PXE boot and UEFI retrieves IP, filename and next-server/TFTP
   from DHCP server
2. UEFI downloads grub2/grubx64.efi from TFTP
3. GRUB2 looks in pxelinux.cfg/<mac address> for PXELinux
   template
4. PXElinux template contains the automated install configuration
   generated by Foreman
5. GRUB2 downloads kernel and initrd and boots the kernel and starts
   the installer
6. After install is complete, PXELinux template is changed back to
   chainload local disk

### Conclusion

The deficiencies of the previous process have been addressed. GRUB2
can boot the 16.04 kernels and even the hwe kernels and installer if I
want to. The menus and boot to local disk are working.
