## Introduction

Three years ago, I read ['Body by Science'][3] and it changed the way I
think about exercise completely. Unfortunately I wasn't able to find a
gym in Ottawa that used this type of training. I then asked Google for
results on 'HIT bodyweight' and found [Drew Baye][1] and [Project
Kratos][2]. After reading most of Drew Baye's blog and watching any videos
I could find with him, I purchased Project Kratos and started my
experiment.

Doing a workout once a week at home was perfect for my life situation
at the time: two young children and full time jobs for my wife and
I. Despite the infrequency I made progress surprisingly quickly. The
squat, heel raise and back extension exercises almost tripled in under
six months. But I quickly plateaued on exercises like the pushup,
chinup and crunch. I tried many different things: negatives, forced
reps, more rest, less rest, split routines, etc. but nothing allowed
me to break through the plateau.

I started experimenting with different programs like [GMB][4]
and [GB][5], but all I lacked the mobility to do even their entry
movements. I also read ['Supple Leopard'][6] by Kelly Starret
and ['Roll Model'][7] by Jill Miller and realized that mobility was
probably my limiting factor. It took a while before I was able to add
my reading about mobility into my exercise mental model. Here is my
current exercise model that I used to setup my latest exercise routine
and goals.

Each movement has three components: mobility, skill and
strength. These three components are related is non-linear ways. Even
if they cannot be separated, it can still be useful to think about the
effect of each component on a movement:

## Mobility

Do the joints, connective tissue and muscles that participate in the
movement have the range of motion required? There are _three_ answers
to this question: yes, no and almost.

- No means the joints do not have the required range of motion. For
example I cannot do a single leg squat because I lack the ankle range
of motion necessary.
- Yes means the range of motion is sufficient for the movement.
- Almost is the most tricky condition because it can look like the
  movement can be done, but it is not optimal.

Examples of "almost" include missing shoulder range of motion so that
the lats are not properly engaged for chinups or pullups. When only
the arm muscles are used, the number of reps will always be limited
and risk of shoulder injury is higher.

Another example is doing a squat without full ankle or hip range of
motion. The squat is possible but it may lead to a rounded back and
that can lead to joint wear and injury.

There are many examples of world class athletes that are still able to
excel even with mobility limitation but they often pay the price for
it later. If mobility restrictions are not addressed, injuries and
plateaus will keep happening. More complicated movements often require
more range of motion but developing range of motion takes much longer
than building skill or strength.

Mobility is more than stretching. Increasing the range of motion
requires convincing the nervous system that extending further is
safe. This requires that the muscle be strong enough and lots of time
being relaxed at the end of the range of motion. The fascia are also
involved. Sometimes there can be adhesion of fascia layers that
prevent proper movement. I have experienced many times injuries and
pains resolved using a lacrosse ball or ART where force is applied to
a trigger point.

## Skill

Skill is the neurological coordination required to do a movement
efficiently. Some movements require little practice, some full body
movements require lots of practice to coordinate all the muscles and
parts of the body properly. This is why practicing a movement without
going to failure can still result in extra repetitions or apparent
strength gains.

Full muscle contraction is another skill that is an important part of
HIT. Learning to contract a muscle or a set of muscles under intense
discomfort takes practice.

## Strength

How best to simulate the body to produce the desired adaptation
response of greater power output and/or muscle size? This is the
component that HIT has focused on. The slow movement to momentary
muscular failure protocol works well, but there are limitations. If a
mobility or skill component is lacking, this will prevent a trainee
from achieving proper muscular failure and simulating an adaptation
response.

## Training for all components

The best way to training for strength is HIT: short, infrequent
movement to momentary muscular failure.

Skill training is best done when the muscles are rested as many skills
require strength to perform properly. Skill training therefore works
best with many repetitions using a lighter load with careful focus on
form.

Mobility training is very different from skill or strength
training. It takes lots of time and is specific to each individual
body. It works best when done daily and integrated into other daily
activities. I have had to find creative ways to combine a usual
activity with stretching or working on fascia. For instance I will
read in straddle stretch and meditate in squat position.

## Programming

How best to combine all this information into a weekly program? That
depends on the goals and time available of course.

If the goal is maximum ROI for minimum time investment, HIT strength
training has the best returns. Movements that do not require skill or
mobility components will have best return and this is why many HIT
gyms use machines. Bodyweight HIT works but many of the movements have
a mobility and skill component and each individual will experience
different limitations.

The next step is to add mobility and skill practice. Unfortunately
both these require significantly more time investment. Choose a
specific skill and do daily mobility and skill repetitions.

For example I choose L-Sit and Crow Pose as skills and I do daily
shoulder and wrist mobility followed by those skills on days when I do
not do HIT strength. The mobility work takes 15-20 minutes. The skill
work only takes a few minutes. I try to fit some more skill work in
during the day to maximize the repetitions.

I have carved out a time for this every day. I will keep going while
there is progress and then switch to something else when I stop
progressing.

## Conclusion

Thanks for reading this far. The key to staying motivated is progress
and the key to progress is focusing on very specific goals.
